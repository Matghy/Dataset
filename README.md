I have procured the latest Drug Combination Database (DrugCombDB), encompassing information on 451 drugs and 123 cell lines. I have systematically organized the structural details of all drugs, stored in SMILES string format. Additionally, I plan to augment these drug entities with their physicochemical properties as features.

Regarding the cell lines, I primarily extracted pertinent information from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress databases. This includes gene expression profiles, RNA expression, copy number variations, and mutation data as features for the cell lines. Concurrently, I am in the process of identifying novel biomarkers to enhance the robustness of the model. I have already curated the data from the CCLE database. Notably, the CCLE database lacks certain cell line information present in DrugCombDB, and I intend to source and incorporate this missing data from other databases.

Furthermore, a subset of cell lines in DrugCombDB originates from non-human organisms such as mice. I am deliberating whether to exclude these particular cell lines from the analysis. Subsequent steps involve normalizing all features, followed by experimental refinement using deep learning and graph neural network (GNN) models on the normalized data.
